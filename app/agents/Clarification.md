VirtualLabState: This is the entire workbench for your agent. It holds all the tools and papers the agent needs for the current job.
> It is the brain / short term memory of the agents 

it contains all items the agents needs right now such as:

task_list (The "to-do" list)
messages (The chat history)
next_agent (The "traffic cop")
scratchpad (Temporary "post-it notes")
audit_log: This is the lab notebook sitting on that workbench. It's where the agent writes down every single thing it does.
